2017 summer project.
STFC Particle Physics Summer Project 
	Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, LHCb Group 
•	Analysed LHCb data of leptonic B meson decays and searched for lepton flavour violation.  
•	Used machine learning methods (neural networks and boosted decision trees) from ROOT TMVA package to separate signal from background. The training was performed using Monte Carlo simulation data. 
•	Developed a program for aligning LHCb RICH detectors. From the data of detected spots of calibration LEDs, the most probable locations of hybrid photon detectors were calculated.
